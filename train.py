# # We start by instantiating the necessary modules: FaceEncoder, FaceDecoder, DiffusionTransformer, MotionFieldEstimator, and Generator. You'll need to load the pretrained weights or initialize these modules accordingly.
# # We prepare the input data, including the video frames, audio features, gaze direction, head distance, and emotion offset. These are just example placeholders, and you'll need to provide the actual input data based on your specific use case.
# # We pass the video frames through the FaceEncoder to extract the canonical 3D appearance volume, identity code, head pose, and facial dynamics code.
# # We generate the holistic facial dynamics using the DiffusionTransformer by providing the facial dynamics code, audio features, gaze direction, head distance, and emotion offset.
# # From the generated dynamics, we extract the source keypoints (kp_s) and driving keypoints (kp_d).
# # We compute the rotation matrices Rs and Rd for the source and driving keypoints, respectively. In this example, we use identity matrices for simplicity, but you should compute the actual rotation matrices based on the head pose.
# # We call the MotionFieldEstimator with the appearance volume, source keypoints, driving keypoints, and rotation matrices. It returns the deformation field, occlusion mask, and an additional occlusion mask (if predict_multiref_occ is set to True).
# # We pass the appearance volume, deformation field, and occlusion mask to the Generator to generate the output image.
# # We reconstruct the face image using the FaceDecoder by providing the appearance volume, identity code, head pose, and generated dynamics.
# # Finally, you can compute the necessary losses, perform backpropagation, and save the generated output image and reconstructed face.
# # Note: Make sure to replace the placeholder input data with your actual data and adjust the dimensions accordingly. Additionally, you'll need to implement the loss functions and the specific training procedure as described in the VASA-1 paper.
